# Design Document

## Overview

The improved media upload flow will transform the current property management system from a separated workflow (property creation â†’ separate media upload) into an integrated, user-friendly experience. The design focuses on three key improvements: integrating media upload directly into property forms, replacing dropdown selection with a searchable property grid, and implementing batch processing with progress tracking and categorization.

## Architecture

### Current System Analysis
The existing system uses:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Separate property creation and media upload workflows
- Dropdown-based property selection for media uploads
- Basic drag-and-drop functionality

### Proposed Architecture
The improved system will maintain the existing tech stack while enhancing the user experience through:
- **Integrated Property Forms**: Media upload components embedded within property creation/edit forms
- **Enhanced Property Selection**: Searchable grid interface with filtering capabilities
- **Batch Processing Engine**: Queue-based upload system with progress tracking
- **Media Categorization**: Tag-based organization system for uploaded media

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Integrated Property Form Component

**PropertyFormWithMedia**
- Extends existing property form functionality
- Embeds media upload zones directly in the form
- Provides real-time preview of selected media
- Handles form validation including media requirements

```javascript
class PropertyFormWithMedia {
  constructor(containerId, propertyId = null) {
    this.containerId = containerId;
    this.propertyId = propertyId;
    this.mediaUploader = new MediaUploader();
    this.formValidator = new FormValidator();
  }
  
  render() {
    // Render property form with integrated media sections
  }
  
  handleSubmit() {
    // Save property data and associated media together
  }
}
```

### 2. Property Search Grid Component

**PropertySearchGrid**
- Replaces dropdown with visual grid interface
- Implements real-time search and filtering
- Shows property thumbnails and key information
- Supports keyboard navigation and accessibility

```javascript
class PropertySearchGrid {
  constructor(containerId, onPropertySelect) {
    this.containerId = containerId;
    this.onPropertySelect = onPropertySelect;
    this.properties = [];
    this.filteredProperties = [];
    this.searchQuery = '';
    this.activeFilters = {};
  }
  
  render() {
    // Render searchable property grid
  }
  
  filterProperties(query, filters) {
    // Apply search and filter logic
  }
  
  selectProperty(propertyId) {
    // Handle property selection
  }
}
```

### 3. Batch Media Processor

**BatchMediaProcessor**
- Manages upload queue and processing
- Provides progress tracking for individual files and overall batch
- Handles upload failures and retry logic
- Supports media categorization during upload

```javascript
class BatchMediaProcessor {
  constructor() {
    this.uploadQueue = [];
    this.activeUploads = new Map();
    this.maxConcurrentUploads = 3;
    this.progressCallbacks = [];
  }
  
  addToQueue(files, propertyId, category) {
    // Add files to upload queue with metadata
  }
  
  processQueue() {
    // Process uploads with concurrency control
  }
  
  trackProgress(callback) {
    // Register progress tracking callback
  }
}
```

### 4. Media Categorization System

**MediaCategorizer**
- Provides tagging interface during upload
- Supports predefined categories (exterior, interior, amenities)
- Allows custom tag creation
- Integrates with property media organization

```javascript
class MediaCategorizer {
  constructor() {
    this.predefinedCategories = ['exterior', 'interior', 'amenities'];
    this.customCategories = [];
  }
  
  renderCategorySelector(fileId) {
    // Render category selection UI for each file
  }
  
  applyCategory(fileId, category) {
    // Apply category to uploaded file
  }
}
```

## Data Models

### Enhanced Property Model
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  // ... existing property fields
  media: {
    images: [
      {
        id: string,
        url: string,
        category: string,
        uploadDate: Date,
        order: number
      }
    ],
    videos: [
      {
        id: string,
        url: string,
        category: string,
        uploadDate: Date,
        duration: number
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Upload Progress Model
```javascript
{
  batchId: string,
  propertyId: number,
  files: [
    {
      fileId: string,
      fileName: string,
      fileSize: number,
      category: string,
      status: 'pending' | 'uploading' | 'completed' | 'failed',
      progress: number,
      error?: string
    }
  ],
  overallProgress: number,
  startTime: Date,
  estimatedCompletion?: Date
}
```

## Error Handling

### Upload Error Management
- **Network Failures**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **File Size Limits**: Pre-upload validation with user feedback
- **Invalid File Types**: Client-side validation with clear error messages
- **Storage Quota**: Graceful handling with upgrade prompts

### User Experience Error Handling
- **Search No Results**: Helpful messaging with suggestions
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with inline error display
- **Progress Interruption**: Background processing with recovery options

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Component Testing**: Individual component functionality
- **Upload Logic**: File processing and queue management
- **Search/Filter Logic**: Property filtering and search algorithms
- **Form Validation**: Property form validation rules

### Integration Testing
- **Form Submission Flow**: End-to-end property creation with media
- **Media Upload Pipeline**: Complete upload process from selection to storage
- **Property Selection Flow**: Search, filter, and selection workflow

### User Experience Testing
- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Cross-browser drag-and-drop testing
