# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to streamline the media upload process for property management by integrating media uploads directly into property workflows, replacing cumbersome dropdown interfaces with intuitive search capabilities, and adding batch processing functionality. The goal is to create a more efficient and user-friendly experience for property managers when handling property media.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to upload media directly during property creation, so that I can complete all property setup in one seamless workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new property THEN the system SHALL display a media upload section within the property creation form
2. WHEN uploading media during property creation THEN the system SHALL support multiple image and video file uploads simultaneously
3. WHEN dragging files over the upload zone THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the drop zone is active
4. WHEN dropping files into the upload zone THEN the system SHALL immediately begin processing the uploaded files
5. IF the property creation form is submitted THEN the system SHALL save both property details and associated media together

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to easily find and select properties when adding media to existing properties, so that I can quickly identify the correct property without scrolling through long lists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the media upload for existing properties THEN the system SHALL display a searchable property grid instead of a dropdown
2. WHEN typing in the property search field THEN the system SHALL filter properties in real-time based on the search query
3. WHEN viewing the property grid THEN the system SHALL display property cards with thumbnails, addresses, and key identifiers
4. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL update the property grid to show only matching properties
5. WHEN clicking on a property card THEN the system SHALL select that property for media upload
6. IF no properties match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want to upload multiple media files efficiently with progress tracking and categorization, so that I can manage large media collections without losing track of upload status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading multiple files THEN the system SHALL process them in batches to optimize performance
2. WHEN files are uploading THEN the system SHALL display individual progress indicators for each file
3. WHEN files are uploading THEN the system SHALL display an overall batch progress indicator
4. WHEN uploading media THEN the system SHALL allow tagging files as "exterior", "interior", or "amenities" during the upload process
5. WHEN an upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and allow retry options
6. WHEN all uploads complete successfully THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with upload summary
7. IF the user navigates away during upload THEN the system SHALL continue processing uploads in the background and notify upon completion
